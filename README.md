# Unemployeement_Analysis
 The unemployment rate is calculated based on a particular region, so to analyze unemployment I will be using an unemployment dataset of India. The dataset I’m using here contains data on India’s unemployment rate during Covid-19. So let’s start the task of Unemployment analysis by importing the necessary Python libraries and the dataset.
 This project can help local authorities, municipalities, government etc. to provide employment to the people affected with unemployment in the country.
